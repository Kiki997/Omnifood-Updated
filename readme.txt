This is a code along project from Jonas Schmedtmann's "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"
on Udemy.
It has been build using only HTML,CSS and a little bit of JS for the mobile navigation,
the sticky navigation and for smooth scrolling.
I learned a lot of best practices about designing good Websites while following ths course,
and a lot of new CSS properties
